# VBA-challenge

In this challenge, I had to create a script in VBA that would loop through all the stocks for each year (2014-2016). The loop had to output the ticker symbol for each stock, yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of the year to the closing price at the end of the year, the percent change from the opening price at the beginning of the year to the closing price at the end of the year, and the total volume of each stock. I also had to add conditional formatting that highlighted a positive yearly change in green, and a negative yearly change in red. I then had to compute the stock with the greatest % increase and greatest % decrease for each year, and the stock with the greatest total volume each year. I first created the script to run for a single year of data, and then edited it so it would loop through each worksheet and output the desired information for each year of stock data.
